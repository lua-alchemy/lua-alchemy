## Lua Alchemy is looking for a logo!

### Brief

See here for the Lua Alchemy project description: http://code.google.com/p/lua-alchemy/

See Lua logos in postscript here: http://www.lua.org/images/

The logo should be recognizable as a "derived" from the original Lua logo. Nevertheless, this is a different product, so the usual (for Lua ecosystem) "put Alchemy on `orbit' dash-line instead of `powered by`" solution would not work here. Anyway, the logo must contain words Lua and Alchemy.

Logo should be presented in SVG _and_ PNG formats in color and black-and-white. For color, sticking to Lua's dark blue + gray + white/transparent is a good idea.

The logo needs to be placed into a free license suitable for non commercial and commercial use and the copyright transfered to Lua Alchemy maintainer, Alexander Gladysh. Logo author would be properly attributed on Lua Alchemy web page, in README and COPYRIGHT files of the Lua Alchemy source distribution.

 

_I'm thinking about replacing "planet with a moon" allusion of Lua logo to an allusion to yin-yang symbol... But any ideas are welcome. -- AG_
