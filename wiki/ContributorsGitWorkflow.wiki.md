# 0. Do not panic!

## Troubleshooting

See [GitHub guides](http://github.com/guides/home) for detailed help. If that does not help, please post a question to the [Developers Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/lua-alchemy-dev). We would be glad to help.

# 1. Ensure you have an account on [GitHub](http://github.com)

## Troubleshooting

If you do not want to register on GitHub you're welcome to contribute patches to the [Developers Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/lua-alchemy-dev).

```
      $ git help format-patch
```

# 2. Ensure your GitHub account have been added to the Lua Alchemy project as contributor

## Troubleshooting

If not, please post a request to do so on [Developers Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/lua-alchemy-dev). Or simply [create a fork](http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications) push your changes there and [request pull](http://github.com/guides/pull-requests).

# 3. Ensure you have contributor's repository cloned

```
  $ git clone git@github.com:lua-alchemy/lua-alchemy.git lua-alchemy.git
```

## Troubleshooting

1. If you have cloned public repository and made changes there, your changes may easily moved to the contributor's repository (or your public clone may be upgraded to contributor's).

See

```
      $ git help format-patch
      $ git help am
      $ git help remote
```

Also see [Changing Your Origin](http://github.com/guides/changing-your-origin) guide.

Or simply ask for help on the [Developers Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/lua-alchemy-dev).

2. During clone (or any other operation) you may encounter error like this:

```
   Permission denied (publickey).
   fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
```

This means that git does not see proper ssh key, associated with your account on GitHub (remember you've [added](http://github.com/guides/providing-your-ssh-key) one when registered?). Ensure it is ssh-add'ed if you're on Linux or Mac, or added to the Pageant if you're on Windows.

See also [Addressing authentication problems with SSH](http://github.com/guides/addressing-authentication-problems-with-ssh) GitHub's guide.

# 4. Update the master branch

```
  $ git fetch origin
  $ git checkout master

  # OUCH! Be careful with the next line, you would lose any changes to master
  # Uncommitted changes are lost permanently
  # (use git stash to save them and to get clean working copy)
  # Committed changes may be restored (git help reflog), but it is not pleasant.

  $ git reset --hard origin/master
```

Note: `git merge origin/master` would do instead. But the hard reset
ensures you did not do any work in the master branch.

# 5. Clone a fresh branch for your feature

```
  $ git checkout master
  $ git checkout -b <prefix>/<branch-name>
```

Please pick yourself an unique short prefix to use with every branch (initials would likely do). Please use unique and descriptive branch names. Branch name should reflect branch contents -- describe "feature", implemented in that branch.

# 6. Do the work

```
  $ git commit
  $ git commit
  # ...
  $ git commit
```

# 7. Push the changes to Lua Alchemy repository

```
  $ git push origin <prefix>/<branch-name>
```

# 8. Request review

Please post short notice to the [Developers Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/lua-alchemy-dev) telling us you've pushed a feature.
