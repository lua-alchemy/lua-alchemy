Background
----------

Lua is a great dynamic programming language, Adobe Flash is a great
universal platform for applications and Adobe Alchemy is the tool to
bind them together.

Lua
---
Lua is a powerful, fast, light-weight, embeddable scripting language.

Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description
constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua
is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based
virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental
garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and
rapid prototyping.

Adobe Flash
-----------

Adobe Flash (previously called "Macromedia Flash"') is a set of
multimedia software created by Macromedia and currently developed and
distributed by Adobe Systems. Since its introduction in 1996, Flash has
become a popular method for adding animation and interactivity to web
pages; Flash is commonly used to create animation, advertisements, and
various web page components, to integrate video into web pages, and more
recently, to develop rich Internet applications.

Adobe Alchemy
-------------

With Alchemy, Web application developers can now reuse hundreds of
millions of lines of existing open source C and C++ client or
server-side code on the Flash Platform. Alchemy brings the power of high
performance C and C++ libraries to Web applications with minimal
degradation on AVM2. The C/C++ code is compiled to ActionScript 3.0 as a
SWF or SWC that runs on Adobe Flash Player 10 or Adobe AIR 1.5.

Motivation
----------

We need Lua Alchemy to...

  * ...To use *run-time dynamic* programming language (Lua) within
    the Flash framework.
  * ...To *reuse* existing Lua code for the Flash-based utilities
  * ...To get a *great cross-platform back-end* (Flash) for (simpler)
    Lua-based games
  * ...To have fun with *awesome* new technology :-)
